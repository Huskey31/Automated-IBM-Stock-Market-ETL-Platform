Project: Extract IBM stock from yahoo finance and clean columns and transform date(index) then load to mini data warehouse (PostgreSQL).I Had this process automated. Next I Created code that will pull IBM stock from mini data warehouse then create a scatter plot with updated data this process is also automated but through different script. there is a ten second delay between scripts acting as a buffer. The graph is then saved to separate folder that saves all previous graphs. This process needs to be successful for 12 hours and needs to run every hour    

   test to start at 2pm and set to automate every hour for 12 hours 
1. 1st test was a success, scatter plot with date stamps successfully outputted, next automation at 3pm 
2. 2nd test was a success, scatter plot with date stamps successfully outputted, next automation at 4pm
3. 3rd test was a success, scatter plot with date stamps successfully outputted, next automation at 5pm,(changed date from extraction point from 2025/12/20 to 2024/12/20)
4. 4th test was a success, scatter plot with date stamps successfully outputted, next automation at 6pm,(changed date from extraction point from 2024/12/20 to 2025/01/01)
5. 5th test was a success, scatter plot with date stamps successfully outputted, next automation at 7pm,(changed date from extraction point from 2025/01/01 to 2023/01/01)
